            <h1>Server is Up and Running</h1>
            <div>You see default page served by the server. You can change this page to whatever you need.
                Simply put <span class="accent">index.html</span> in your server's root folder.</div>
            <div>Whatever you put in the server folder will be accessible through the <a href="/" class="location accent">URL</a>.
                For example to access this site you are using certificate available at this URL <a href="/certificate.crt" class="location-crt accent">TODO URL</a>,
                mapped to your server's folder.</div>
            <div>Replace <span class="accent">certificate.crt</span> and <span class="accent">private.key</span> with your trusted certificate and private key
                to resolve browser warning message. The <span class="accent">private.key</span> is designed to be not available for the users.
            </div>
            <div>If you put file bigger than there is available memory and then request it,
                server will be stopped with an error.</div>
            <div>These are default resources provided by the server: <span class="accent">favicon.svg, index.html, 404.html,
                script.js</span> and <span class="accent">style.css</span>. To override put corresponding files in the server's root folder.</div>
            <div>Security based restrictions:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resource inclusion works only via https. This means if you try to include any js, css, image, video,
                        whatever, it needs to be served on https server</li>
                    <li>Inline javascript won't be executed. You need to put all js as scripts.</li>
                    <li>On supported browsers, Referer header won't be sent.</li>
                    <li>Website can not be used in iframe on other domains.</li>
                    <li>Resources will be sent to a user with a Content-Type based on file extension.
                        In practice this means if you, for example, create a js file named script.jstypo,
                        it won't be interpreted by a client's browser. Use correct file extensions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Directory listing is not implemented. The reason behind this decision is security. To eliminate accidental sharing of unintended files.
                        <br>
                        As a workaround you can create html file with list of files you need to make available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cookies are not implemented for Rust Web Server.
                        As a developer you may use
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage">sessionStorage</a> to bypass absence
                        of the cookies.

                </ul>
