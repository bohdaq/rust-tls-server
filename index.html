            <h1>Server is Up and Running</h1>
            <div>You see default page served by the server. You can change this page to whatever you need,
                simply by replacing <span class="accent">index.html</span> in your server folder.</div>
            <div>Whatever you put in the server folder will be accessible through the <span class="accent">URL</span>.
                For example to access this site you are using certificate available at this <span class="accent">TODO URL</span>,
                mapped to your server's folder.</div>
            <div>If you put file bigger than there is available memory and then request it via <span class="accent">TODO URL</span>,
                server will be stopped with an error.</div>
